            <p>
              Manual lymphatic drainage is an extremely effective therapy for
              treating tissue swelling caused by congenital or acquired
              lymphatic drainage disorders. Edema can also occur after
              accidents, operations or during pregnancy. Various techniques are
              used to support and stimulate lymphatic drainage. The therapeutic
              effect is further enhanced through the use of compression bandages
              and specific body positions. In addition to treating lymphatic
              drainage disorders, we also focus on lipedema, a disease that
              leads to an uneven distribution of body fat.
