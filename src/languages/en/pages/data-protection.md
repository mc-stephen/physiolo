**Video conferences/communication (online media)**  
In order to be able to communicate with our customers and business partners as personally as possible, even in special times and situations, we use the appropriate software solutions available if necessary to be able to offer telephone conferences, online meetings and video conferences.

In order to take part in “online meetings” or enter a “meeting room”, you may need to. asked to at least provide information about your name. This is so that the moderator can grant you access. Anonymous participation is often also possible.

Personal data processed in connection with participation in “online meetings” will generally not be passed on to third parties unless they are specifically intended to be passed on. Please note that content from “online meetings” as well as personal meetings are often used to communicate information with customers, interested parties or third parties and are therefore intended to be passed on.

Meeting metadata: topic, description (optional), participant IP addresses, device/hardware information. For recordings: MP4 file of all video, audio and presentation recordings,

M4A file of all audio recordings, text file of online meeting chat.

Other recipients: The provider of the online conference necessarily receives knowledge of the above-mentioned data.

We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with customers, interested parties and users who are active there and inform them about our services.

We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This can result in risks for users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce {"users'"} rights.

Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of the user. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the {"users'"} computers, in which the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage profiles regardless of the devices used by the users (particularly if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

The processing of {"users'"} personal data is based on our legitimate interests in effectively informing users and communicating with users in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f of the GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective platform providers for their consent to the data processing described above, the legal basis for the processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a., Article 7 GDPR.

For a detailed description of the respective processing and the objection options (opt-out), we refer to the information provided by the providers linked below.

Even in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we would like to point out that these can most effectively be asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to user data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.
