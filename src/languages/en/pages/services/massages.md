MASSAGES
--------

Massages involve the mechanical manipulation of the skin, connective tissue, and muscles using stretching, pulling, and pressure stimuli.

The effects of massage extend from the treated body part to the entire organism and also involve the psyche. We treat all types of back problems, offer sports massages, as well as relaxation massages.

Muscle tension is reduced or completely eliminated through our classic massage therapies:
