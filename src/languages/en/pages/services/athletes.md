BUILDING AND TRAINING ATHLETES

BUILDING AND TRAINING ATHLETES
------------------------------

Common problems experienced by athletes include injuries to the musculoskeletal system such as strains, knee damage or torn muscle fibers. These can be prevented or remedied with holistic therapy (heat/cold, physiotherapy and KG). This is primarily about prevention with the aim of being able to do sport in the long term. Here we create an individual treatment concept that supports the patient in rehabilitation and restores the old functionality, for example through rehabilitation training. We have a lot of experience with footballers and we got each of them back on the pitch in a very short time.
