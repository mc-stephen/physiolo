Cranio- (skull with upper jaw) mandibular (lower jaw) dysfunction (functional impairment) includes all painful and non-painful conditions that result from dysregulation of the muscle, jaw, and/or temporomandibular joint function. Problems in the head, neck, and shoulder areas as well as misalignments of the cervical spine often lead to overloading or improper loading of the jaw muscles and temporomandibular joints. Particularly, stress also promotes CMD. In our therapy, the temporomandibular joint is mobilized, pain points are treated, the cervical spine is also treated, and the neck muscles are relaxed.
