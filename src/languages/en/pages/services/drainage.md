MANUAL LYMPH DRAINAGE

Manual lymphatic drainage is an extremely effective therapy for treating tissue swelling caused by congenital or acquired lymphatic drainage disorders. Edema can also occur after accidents, operations or during pregnancy. Various techniques are used to support and stimulate lymphatic drainage. The therapeutic effect is further enhanced through the use of compression bandages and specific body positions. In addition to treating lymphatic drainage disorders, we also focus on lipedema, a disease that leads to an uneven distribution of body fat.

The following conditions and complaints can be treated with manual lymphatic drainage:

*   Chronic lymphedema
*   Chronic venous insufficiency
*   Post-operative swelling
*   Hamstring tears
*   Chronic polyarthritis
*   CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome)
*   Swelling after hemiplegia resulting from a stroke
