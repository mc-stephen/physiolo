HEAT THERAPY
------------

Heat therapy induces muscle relaxation, improves blood circulation, elasticity of collagenous connective tissue, and has pain-relieving effects. Heat therapy is particularly used for neck pain, chronic back pain, joint issues, and muscle tension. Heat should not be applied in cases of inflammatory conditions.
